History:	
In connection with the war between Russia and Japan in January 1905 shipbuilding engineer Ivan Bubnov submitted to the naval authorities his new submarine project. The design envisaged a submarine capable of operating in the coastal waters of Japan and attacking military vessels in enemy harbours. The Russian Naval Technical Committee approved the project on 3 May 1905. The initial design stipulated oil-powered engines. Soon the shipbuilding engineer proposed another solution. For improved safety the engines were now diesels, there were three of them (totalling 900 hp) plus three propellers. According to some sources, only two diesel engines were installed and the third propeller was connected to an electric motor. One peculiarity of this particular submarine was that it did not have watertight bulkheads. Construction of the Akula submarine began at a shipyard in St Petersburg on 7 December 1906. The delay was primarily due to the fact that Russian production facilities were unable to build engines quickly for this unique prototype vessel. The diesel engines were ready only in March 1909.
The submarine was launched festively in St Petersburg on 22 August 1909. Intense sea trials followed. The most serious deficiency was that the propellers were capable of accelerating the surfaced submarine to a maximum speed of only 8.5 knots. From 1909-1911 the Akula underwent various trials near Kronstadt, off Björko and in Tallinn Bay. For instance, on 5 June 1910 the first torpedo firings were performed and during the same month the propellers were replaced. In November the submarine practiced submerging in Tallinn Bay. In the course of 1911 the vessel submerged 40 and covered a total distance of 182 nautical miles under water. The sea trials of the Akula were officially completed on 14 September 1911 when the naval technical commission allowed the submarine to enter into combat service. That was the first submarine completely developed in Russia and capable of performing patrol and escort duties in the open sea for longer periods of time.
On 6 November 1911 the Akula was assigned to the Baltic Fleet and on 25 March 1912 it was transferred to the Second Submarine Brigade.

Story of Sinking:	
When the war broke out in the middle of 1914, Russia’s Baltic Fleet had a total of 11 submarines and the Akula was the best one of them. The submarine brigades comprised mostly of the older Kaiman and Som class vessels.

The Akula submarine undertook 19 patrol missions during the First World War, none of which yielded results. The Akula is considered to be the first Russian submarine to have performed a torpedo attack. The enemy ship was attacked during the fifth mission: the submarine was sent to the Kõpu Peninsula area to wait there until the evening, monitoring hostile movements. On the night of 8 September 1914 the captain decided to enter the Swedish waters in order to torpedo enemy ships in the open sea. Approximately at the 60th nautical mile the crew spotted the German cruiser Amazone and fired one torpedo towards it, which failed to impact the target. Then several German destroyers arrived and the Akula was forced to submerge and flee. The 19th mission turned out to be the last one. In November 1915 the Akula was sent out to patrol the sea to the west of Hiiumaa Island. It bumped into a mine and sank with all crewmembers. The total number of the deceased sailors was 35. At the time of the submarine’s demise it was commanded by II Rank Captain Nikolai Gudim (20.02-28.11.1915). The submarine was struck off the Baltic Fleet roster on 15 March 1917.

The wreck of the submarine was found in 2012 and is situated 12 miles to the north of Kõpu Peninsula. The sea depth at the location is 26-29 metres.
Due to the mine explosion the hull had broken into pieces closer to the bow. The largest part preserved in one piece is about 42 metres long. There are also numerous smaller bits of the submarine strewn across the seafloor.
