WHAT ?
A British merchant ship designed to carry fuel and machinery.  Built in 1912 for the Anglo Saxon Petroleum Company, she displaced 4,900 tons and was 374 feet long.    

WHERE ?
The stern section lies approximately 24 km (15 miles) north of Ras Banas and 85 km south of Marsa Alam and only a short distance from the shoreline.   

WHEN ?
The ship broke in two on 4 April 1943 and the bow and stern sections sank separately the following day.   

WHY ?
The ship was attacked by twin engined Italian SM 79 Sparviero torpedo bombers on 20 August 1942, while on route from Haifa (Palestine) to Alexandria with fuel supplies for the British Mediterranean fleet. She survived a single torpedo hit but sustained serious hull damage.  According to the Captain’s report

“The pump room and number three, four and five holds were flooded, the deck was buckled on the starboard side between 3 and 4 tanks and there was a large hole in the ship’s side some 40 feet fore and aft”.   

The damage was so extensive that she could not be repaired so it was decided to tow her out to Karachi for use as a fuel storage hulk.  However she broke up 24 km (15 miles) north of Ras Banas.  The bow section was sunk by gunfire as it had become a menace to shipping while the stern section foundered off the reef.

WHO ?
As the ship was empty and was being towed to be used as a storage tank in Karachi, it’s unlikely there were many on board when she foundered.   There are no reports of any casualties.  

DEPTH OF WRECK
The vessel lies on its’ side with its’ starboard flank about 18 metres below the surface while its’ port side rests on a sandy bed some 28 metres deep and close to the reef face.  

ANY UNSALVAGED CARGO/ITEMS ?
Apparently a surprising amount given that this ship was on its’ final voyage. This includes various equipment in the workshop including a lathe, oil cans and even a watering can. 

WRECK CONDITION
Given that this ship was torpedoed and subsequently broke up and that the wreck is only the stern section, what remains is surprisingly intact. It’s possible with care to explore the huge engine room and to swim around three floors. Many of the handrails, gauges and valves are still intact.  </span></fieldset></div><h3>Dives for this Place</h3><ol><li class="dive_link" onclick="link_dive(235)">Dive 235 2009-05-22 14:10</li><li class="dive_link" onclick="link_dive(316)">Dive 316 2010-05-11 12:14</li></ol>
